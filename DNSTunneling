MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1048 is concerned with malicious actors using a client machine to send a lot more data than it gets using a different protocol like Domain Name Service (DNS). Usually, SOC teams donâ€™t keep an eye on DNS because it's mostly used for translating domain names, not moving data around. 
DNS queries can actually move data between connected systems. And that's a problem because it makes DNS an easy way for cyber-attacks to send commands and sneak out data using DNS tunneling.

This SPL queries for any device that is sending five times or more data than it is getting. I used the botsv3 index. 

index="botsv3" sourcetype=stream:dns
| stats sum(bytes_out) as bytes_sent sum(bytes_in) as bytes_received by src_ip
| eval bytes_ratio=bytes_sent/bytes_received
| where bytes_ratio>5 
| rename src_ip as client_ip
| fields client_ip, src_ip, bytes_sent, bytes_received, bytes_ratio
